## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public issue

**Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately.**

### 2. Contact us directly

- **Email**: security@stealthflow.org (preferred)
- **GitHub**: Send a private vulnerability report through GitHub's security tab

### 3. Include detailed information

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Environment**: Operating system, versions, configurations
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### 4. Response timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours with preliminary assessment
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues within 7 days, others within 30 days

## Security Measures

### Current Security Features

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse
- **Secure Communication**: TLS encryption for all connections
- **No Logging**: Zero-log policy for privacy protection
- **Regular Audits**: Automated security testing and manual reviews

### Security Best Practices

**For Server Administrators:**
- Keep the system updated with latest security patches
- Use strong passwords and SSH key authentication
- Enable firewall and close unnecessary ports
- Regular security audits and monitoring
- Backup configurations securely

**For Client Users:**
- Download only from official sources
- Keep client software updated
- Use secure network connections
- Verify configuration integrity
- Report suspicious activity

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
